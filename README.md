# ihdw
I hate dynamic website.. ironically, this is a backend for a static website generator. LOL
# How to use ?
- pip install git+https://github.com/hantlowt/ihdw
- from ihdw import serve
- serve(host='localhost', port=1910)

If there is no database in the folder, ihdw create one automatically, intialize a global configuration and create a SuperAdmin account with name = root and password = root
